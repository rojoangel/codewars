### A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

### Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number):

> In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples

```
Square.isSquare(-1) // => false
Square.isSquare( 3) // => false
Square.isSquare( 4) // => true
Square.isSquare(25) // => true
Square.isSquare(26) // => false
```
```
c#
Kata.isSquare(-1) // => false
Kata.isSquare( 3) // => false
Kata.isSquare( 4) // => true
Kata.isSquare(25) // => true
Kata.isSquare(26) // => false
```
