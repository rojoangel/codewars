Write a function that finds the sum of all its arguments.

eg:

```clj
(sum 1 2 3) ; => 6
(sum 8 2) ; => 10
(sum 1 2 3 4 5) ; => 15
```
Note that Python's function name is ```sum_args```, as to avoid confusion with the preexistsing ```sum``` function. Ruby's ```Array#sum``` has been removed to make it a bit more interesting!
